# My-YouTube-research

In my self-directed data science project, I used Youtube API to collect crucial metrics from 25 prominent data science YouTube channels. The gathered data included channel names, subscriber counts, view counts, and video counts. My primary objective was to identify the channels with the highest view counts and then manually examine their video content. This analysis aimed to determine whether the videos were more explanatory or focused on visual and animation elements, as these factors often enhance engagement and understanding of data science topics. By decoding the types of videos that resonate with viewers in the data science domain, I aimed to uncover valuable insights.

Furthermore, I conducted a comprehensive survey among students from the 2023 cohort of the University of British Columbia's Master of Data Science (UBC MDS) program. The survey aimed to assess the perceived difficulty of various data science courses offered by the university, allowing me to rank them accordingly. This process provided crucial insights into which courses posed the greatest challenges for students. Leveraging this information, I was able to identify specific topics and courses that would be ideal for a data science-focused YouTube channel tailored to UBC MDS students.

By integrating web scraping techniques, meticulous data analysis, and the survey's insights, my project sheds light on the most influential data science YouTube channels based on key metrics. Additionally, it provides aspiring content creators with valuable guidance to narrow down their topics and create engaging videos specifically aimed at UBC MDS students.
